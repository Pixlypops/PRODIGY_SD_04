# Sudoku Solver in C++

This project is a Sudoku Solver built using C++. The program is designed to solve Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. 

Users can either input their own Sudoku grid or generate a random one to solve. It features a straightforward approach to solving and displaying Sudoku puzzles.

## Features

- **Custom Input**: Allows users to input their own Sudoku grid and solve it.
- **Random Puzzle Generation**: Generates a random Sudoku puzzle for users to solve.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Uses a backtracking approach to find and display the solution.
- **Simple and Clear Code**: The code is written with clarity in mind, avoiding complex constructs and dynamic memory allocation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this project, you'll need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- A development environment (e.g., VS Code, CLion)

### Building and Running

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-solver.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd sudoku-solver
    ```
3. Compile the program:
    ```bash
    g++ -o sudoku_solver main.cpp
    ```
4. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./sudoku_solver
    ```

### Usage

1. **Choose Your Input Method**: 
   - Enter 'y' to input your own Sudoku grid.
   - Enter 'n' to generate a random Sudoku puzzle.

2. **Input Grid** (if choosing custom input): Enter the Sudoku grid with numbers from 1 to 9 and 0 for empty cells.

3. **Solve Puzzle**: The program will attempt to solve the Sudoku puzzle. Press 'n' when you want the program to solve it if you were solving it yourself.

4. **View Solution**: Once solved, the program will display the completed Sudoku grid.
